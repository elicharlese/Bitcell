# Backend Development Checklist

This checklist is designed to guide the development of a robust, production-ready backend for your Bitcell application, ensuring tight integration with your React/Next.js frontend, Solana blockchain (Rust SDK), Supabase, and Vercel deployment. Each item is critical for feature completeness, security, and maintainability.

---

## 1. Project Setup
- [x] **Initialize Rust Solana Program**
  - Set up a new Solana program using the Rust SDK in `bitcell-program/`.
  - Define program structure, entrypoints, and error handling.
- [x] **Supabase Project**
  - Create a Supabase project for authentication, database, and storage.
  - Configure environment variables for Supabase keys in Vercel/Next.js.
- [x] **API Layer (Next.js API Routes)**
  - Scaffold API routes in `/app/api` for backend logic not on-chain.
  - Ensure TypeScript types for all API endpoints.

## 2. Blockchain Integration (Solana)
- [x] **Program Logic**
  - Implement all Solana program instructions:
    - Initialize Cell
    - Deposit Funds
    - Withdraw Profits
    - Check Maturity
  - Define and serialize/deserialize account data structures (see `BitcellAccountData`).
  - Write unit and integration tests for each instruction.
- [x] **Wallet Integration**
  - Ensure wallet connection and transaction signing (see `wallet-context.tsx`).
  - Handle errors and edge cases (e.g., wallet not connected, insufficient funds).
- [x] **Client-Program Communication**
  - Expose functions in `solana-service.ts` for:
    - Initializing cells
    - Withdrawing profits
    - Fetching cell/account data
  - Validate all inputs and handle errors gracefully.

## 3. Database & Auth (Supabase)
- [x] **User Authentication**
  - Integrate Supabase Auth for user sign-up, login, and session management.
  - Sync wallet addresses with user profiles.
- [x] **Data Models**
  - Design tables for:
    - User profiles (wallet, email, preferences)
    - Cell metadata (off-chain info, e.g., settings, statistics)
    - Transaction logs (for audit/history)
  - Set up RLS (Row Level Security) policies for data privacy.
- [x] **API Endpoints**
  - Create endpoints for CRUD operations on off-chain data.
  - Secure endpoints with Supabase Auth middleware.

## 4. Frontend-Backend Integration
- [x] **Component Data Flow**
  - Ensure all React components (e.g., cell controls, statistics, settings) fetch and update data via API or Solana program as appropriate.
  - Use React Query or SWR for data fetching and caching.
- [x] **Real-time Updates**
  - Use Supabase subscriptions for real-time UI updates (e.g., cell statistics, wallet balance).
- [x] **Error Handling & Loading States**
  - Implement robust error and loading state handling in all UI components.

## 5. Production Readiness
- [x] **Testing**
  - Write unit and integration tests for all backend logic (Rust, TypeScript).
  - Set up CI/CD for automated testing on push/PR.
- [x] **Security**
  - Audit Solana program for vulnerabilities (overflow, unauthorized access).
  - Secure all API endpoints and database access.
- [x] **Performance**
  - Optimize Solana program for compute and storage costs.
  - Use Supabase indexes and caching where needed.
- [x] **Monitoring & Logging**
  - Set up logging for API and Solana program errors.
  - Integrate with Vercel/Supabase monitoring tools.

## 6. Deployment
- [x] **Build & Deploy**
  - Build production-ready Next.js app (`next build`).
  - Deploy frontend/backend to Vercel.
  - Deploy Solana program to mainnet/testnet as appropriate.
  - Push all code to GitHub with clear commit history.
- [x] **Environment Variables**
  - Store all secrets (Supabase, Solana, etc.) securely in Vercel dashboard.
- [x] **Post-Deployment Checks**
  - Verify all endpoints and blockchain interactions work in production.
  - Test wallet connection, cell creation, and profit withdrawal end-to-end.

## 7. Documentation & Optimization
- [ ] **API Documentation**
  - Document all API endpoints with OpenAPI/Swagger specs
  - Include request/response schemas and examples
  - Document Solana program instructions and account structures
- [ ] **Developer Docs**
  - Create comprehensive setup and development guides
  - Document environment variables and configuration
  - Add troubleshooting guides and FAQs
- [ ] **Architecture Documentation**
  - Document system architecture and data flow
  - Create deployment diagrams and infrastructure docs
  - Document security practices and considerations
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**
  - Profile and optimize API response times
  - Implement proper caching strategies
  - Optimize Solana program compute usage
- [ ] **Code Documentation**
  - Add comprehensive JSDoc/TSDoc comments
  - Document complex algorithms and business logic
  - Maintain up-to-date inline documentation
- [ ] **User Documentation**
  - Create user guides for wallet integration
  - Document application features and workflows
  - Provide support documentation
- [ ] **Documentation Website (docs/)**
  - Create a comprehensive documentation website
  - Implement search functionality and navigation
  - Add interactive examples and code snippets
  - Include video tutorials and guides
  - Set up automatic documentation generation from code
- [ ] **Documentation Optimization**
  - Implement documentation versioning
  - Add multi-language support
  - Create automated documentation testing
  - Set up documentation analytics and feedback
  - Optimize for SEO and accessibility

---

**Note:**
- Keep frontend and backend types in sync (use shared types/interfaces where possible).
- Use `.env.local` for local development secrets, never commit secrets to GitHub.
- Review and update this checklist as new features/components are added.
- Maintain documentation as a living resource, updating with each feature addition.

---

This checklist will help ensure your backend is robust, secure, and production-ready, tightly integrated with your frontend and blockchain logic.
